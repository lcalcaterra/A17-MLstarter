# A17-MLstarter
A17 is a simple AUTO Machine Learning Model


The idea behind this work is to create a AUTOML model that contains some facilitations as:
- Managing NaN values
- Encoding of variables
- Hyperparameters Optimization

This model is based on XGBOOST Regressor and want to be only an exercise for me, and an example for you!

Furthermore, I create only a base version and in the next weeks I hope to update this project with more features.

### Use it and have FUN!
